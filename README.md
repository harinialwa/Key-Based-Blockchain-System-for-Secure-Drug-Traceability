# Key-Based-Blockchain-System-for-Secure-Drug-Traceability

## Overview

This project aims to create a **blockchain-based pharmaceutical traceability system** that leverages **key-based mechanisms** and **smart contracts** to ensure **secure, transparent**, and **tamper-proof** drug distribution. The system helps in tracking and verifying pharmaceutical products, combating counterfeit drugs, and ensuring the integrity of the supply chain.

## Technologies Used

- **Blockchain** (Ganache for private network)
- **Smart Contracts** (Solidity)
- **Decentralized Application (DApp)**  
- **JavaScript, Python**
- **Ganache** (for testing and deploying smart contracts)

## Features

- **End-to-end traceability** of pharmaceutical products within the supply chain.
- **Secure transaction recording** using smart contracts on the blockchain.
- **Tamper-proof ledger** for verifying the authenticity and movement of drugs.
- **Decentralized application (DApp)** for secure access and transparency for all stakeholders.
